# Online Help Desk

> This project is aimed at developing an Online Help Desk (OHD) for the facilities in the campus. This is an Intranet based application that can be accessed throughout the campus. This system can be used to automate the workflow of service requests for the various facilities in the campus. This is one integrated system that covers different kinds of facilities like class-rooms, labs, hostels, mess, canteen, gymnasium, computer center, faculty club etc. Registered users (students, faculty, lab-assistants and others) will be able to log in a request for service for any of the supported facilities. These requests will be sent to the concerned people, who are also valid users of the system, to get them resolved. There are features like email notifications/reminders, addition of a new facility to the system, report generators etc in this system.
